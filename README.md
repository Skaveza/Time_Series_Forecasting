#  Air Quality Forecasting with LSTM

This project focuses on forecasting air pollution levels ‚Äî specifically PM2.5 concentrations ‚Äî using deep learning models, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition on air quality prediction.
